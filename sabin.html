    <h1>Facebook</h1>
   <p> Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by American company Meta Platforms. Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of July 2022, Facebook claimed 2.93 billion monthly active users,[6] and ranked third worldwide among the most visited websites as of July 2022.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[8]

<br>
<h2>income and source of income</h2><br>
<p>How Facebook makes money is for the most part through digital advertising. Due to its enormous number of users and social media reach (its platforms and apps are free to users), advertisers large and small consider Meta a prime opportunity to present ads to viewers.</p>
<h2>problems of Facebook</h2>
<p>why not to use facebook?The use of Facebook can have negative psychological effects that include feelings of sexual jealousy, stress, lack of attention, and social media addiction that in some cases is comparable to drug addiction.</p>
<br>
<strong>Furthermore, school grades suffer much when students spend too much time on Facebook as their valuable study time is lost. Besides, some studies suggest that so-called teenage "hyper social networkers" are more likely to engage in risky behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, drug use, fighting and promiscuity</strong>
<h3>does facebook sell your information</h3>
<p>
    But the question remains, does Facebook sell your data? The good news is that Facebook doesn't sell user data to third parties. The bad news is that instead, it sells targeted advertising. Targeted ads make Facebook a lot of money.of course not .</p>
